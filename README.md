# Supportive-Dad-Bot
A basic discord bot written in python that responds with supportive messages from a father figure. A bot created for the use on the chat application discord, that can be activated whenever someone types "I'm"/"im"/"IM"/etc in a chat box. It will then respond with the entire phrase that the user puts after "I'm" and then a supportive phrase.
